/**
 * An HTTP/2 handler that creates child channels for each stream. This handler must be used in combination
 * with {@link Http2FrameCodec}.
 *
 * <p>When a new stream is created, a new {@link Channel} is created for it. Applications send and
 * receive {@link Http2StreamFrame}s on the created channel. {@link Buffer}s cannot be processed by the channel;
 * all writes that reach the head of the pipeline must be an instance of {@link Http2StreamFrame}. Writes that reach
 * the head of the pipeline are processed directly by this handler and cannot be intercepted.
 *
 * <p>The child channel will be notified of user events that impact the stream, such as {@link
 * Http2GoAwayFrame} and {@link Http2ResetFrame}, as soon as they occur. Although {@code
 * Http2GoAwayFrame} and {@code Http2ResetFrame} signify that the remote is ignoring further
 * communication, closing of the channel is delayed until any inbound queue is drained with {@link
 * Channel#read()}, which follows the default behavior of channels in Netty. Applications are
 * free to close the channel in response to such events if they don't have use for any queued
 * messages. Any connection level events like {@link Http2SettingsFrame} and {@link Http2GoAwayFrame}
 * will be processed internally and also propagated down the pipeline for other handlers to act on.
 *
 * <p>Outbound streams are supported via the {@link Http2StreamChannelBootstrap}.
 *
 * <p>{@link ChannelConfig#setMaxMessagesPerRead(int)} and {@link ChannelConfig#setAutoRead(boolean)} are supported.
 *
 * <h3>Resources</h3>
 *
 * Some {@link Http2StreamFrame}s implement the {@link Resource} interface, as they carry
 * resource objects (e.g. {@link Buffer}s). An application handler needs to close or dispose of
 * such objects after having consumed them.
 *
 * <h3>Channel Events</h3>
 *
 * A child channel becomes active as soon as it is registered to an {@link EventLoop}. Therefore, an active channel
 * does not map to an active HTTP/2 stream immediately. Only once a {@link Http2HeadersFrame} has been successfully sent
 * or received, does the channel map to an active HTTP/2 stream. In case it is not possible to open a new HTTP/2 stream
 * (i.e. due to the maximum number of active streams being exceeded), the child channel receives an exception
 * indicating the cause and is closed immediately thereafter.
 *
 * <h3>Writability and Flow Control</h3>
 *
 * A child channel observes outbound/remote flow control via the channel's writability. A channel only becomes writable
 * when it maps to an active HTTP/2 stream . A child channel does not know about the connection-level flow control
 * window. {@link ChannelHandler}s are free to ignore the channel's writability, in which case the excessive writes will
 * be buffered by the parent channel. It's important to note that only {@link Http2DataFrame}s are subject to
 * HTTP/2 flow control.
